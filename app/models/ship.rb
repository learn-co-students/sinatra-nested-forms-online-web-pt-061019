# Create two classes, a Pirate class and a Ship class.
# Pirates should have a name, weight, and height.
# You will also need a class method that returns all the pirates.
# The ship class should have name, type, and booty attributes, as well as a class
# method .all that returns all the ships and a class method .clear that deletes all ships.
